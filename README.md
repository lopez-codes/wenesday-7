This repository contains code and files for the "Wenesday" project. Wenesday is a web application that allows users to create and share their favorite recipes, as well as browse recipes from other users.

Provider: IT.lopez-be.ch >> lopez.codes >> lopez.zone >> lopez.one

Getting Started:

This project is a web application called "Wenesday" that allows users to create, share, and browse their favorite algorithms. The application is built using React, React-Router, Redux, Material-UI, and Firebase and includes endpoints that enable the creation, updating, and deletion of algorithms. Users can also search for algorithms and filter them by various criteria. The goal of Wenesday is to create a vibrant community of algorithm enthusiasts and foster the exchange of algorithmic ideas.

If you would like to contribute to the Wenesday project, you can do so by cloning the repository to your local machine. To do this, you will need to have Git installed on your computer. Once you have Git installed, you can clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

>> git clone https://github.com/blopen/free-wenesday-free

After you have cloned the repository, you can make changes to the code and files as needed. When you are ready to commit your changes, be sure to create a new branch and commit your changes to that branch.

## Simple C++ Example for Arch Linux

The `right` directory includes `beginner_program.cpp`, a minimal C++ program. On Arch Linux (or in a virtual machine/hypervisor), compile it with:

```bash
g++ right/beginner_program.cpp -o beginner_program
./beginner_program
```

You should see the greeting `Hello from Wenesday C++!` printed to your terminal. This small example helps verify that a basic C++ toolchain is working.

## Repository Overview for Beginners

The project contains many experimental folders. Key locations:

- `back/ONE` – third-party projects including the Unreal Engine `OpenAIApi` plugin. See `back/ONE/OpenAIApi/README.md` for setup instructions.
- `front/CPU` – JavaScript tools to record and replay mouse clicks.
- `bin` – sample scripts such as a small OpenAI API example in Python.
- `right` – beginner-friendly examples. Start with `right/beginner_program.py` and the README in that folder.
- `arch` – resources for setting up an Arch Linux environment tailored for AI development.

To verify your environment, run:

```bash
cd right
python beginner_program.py
```

This should print:

```
Hello from Wenesday!
```

Knowledge of Git, JavaScript/Node.js and Python will help you explore the rest of the project.

## Arch Linux for AI Development

The `arch` folder provides scripts and documentation to transform a minimal Arch Linux installation into a development workstation for machine learning. Follow the steps in `arch/README.md` and run `arch/install_ai_packages.sh` to install Python and common libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. The docs also show how to install the GRUB bootloader and the GNOME desktop so the system works well as a regular OS.
