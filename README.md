## Simple C++ Example for Arch Linux

The `right` directory includes `beginner_program.cpp`, a minimal C++ program. On Arch Linux (or in a virtual machine/hypervisor), compile it with:

```bash
g++ right/beginner_program.cpp -o beginner_program
./beginner_program
```

You should see the greeting `Hello from Wenesday C++!` printed to your terminal. This small example helps verify that a basic C++ toolchain is working.
