## Repository Overview for Beginners

The project contains many experimental folders. Key locations:

- `back/ONE` – third-party projects including the Unreal Engine `OpenAIApi` plugin. See `back/ONE/OpenAIApi/README.md` for setup instructions.
- `front/CPU` – JavaScript tools to record and replay mouse clicks.
- `bin` – sample scripts such as a small OpenAI API example in Python.
- `right` – beginner-friendly examples. Start with `right/beginner_program.py` and the README in that folder.

To verify your environment, run:

```bash
cd right
python beginner_program.py
```

This should print:

```
Hello from Wenesday!
```

Knowledge of Git, JavaScript/Node.js and Python will help you explore the rest of the project.
