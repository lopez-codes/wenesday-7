This folder holds small experiments and sample code. The files here can help beginners test their toolchain.

## beginner_program.py

Running this Python script prints a simple greeting. Use it to verify that your Python environment works:

```bash
python beginner_program.py
```

It should output:

```
Hello from Wenesday!
```

## beginner_program.cpp

A tiny C++ example that does the same. Compile it with `g++` (or `clang++`) and run the produced executable:

```bash
g++ beginner_program.cpp -o beginner_program
./beginner_program
```

You should see:

```
Hello from Wenesday C++!
```

Feel free to extend these scripts as you learn.
